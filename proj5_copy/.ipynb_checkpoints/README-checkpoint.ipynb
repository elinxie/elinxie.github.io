The variables c_start and c_end are depth c values from -1.0 to 1.0. The function makes refocused images starting from the c_start value and going to the c_end value in steps of variable step. The default value is 0.05. The images are then put together as a gif.\n",

The variables start and end are apeture n values from 0 to 8 (assuming your lightfield is a 17x17 matrix of images).
